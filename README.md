# Agent_Recruitment_Analysis

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Fintro is an offline financial distribution company operating across India from past 10 years. They sell financial products to consumers with the help of agents. The managers at Fintro identify the right talents and recruit these agents. Once the candidate has been hired by the company they undergo a training for next 7 days and have to clear an assessment to become an agent with Fintro.  The agents work as freelancers and get paid in commission for each product they sell.

However, Fintro is facing a challenge of not being able to generate enough business from its agents.

The problem – Who are the best agents?
Fintro invests invaluable time and money in recruiting & training the agents. They expect the agent to have selling skills and generate as much business for the company as possible. But some agents don’t perform, as expected.

Fintro has shared the details of all the agents they have recruited from 2007 to 2009. The data contained demographics of the agents hired and the managers who hired them. They want the data scientists to provide insights from past recruitment data and help them identify / hire potential agents.
